If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

im not very knowlegable about music, i guess it is on average outgoing?
i dont know whether it is in fact more outgoing than average

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might
not be very representative of the listener.
maybe people listen to music individually and the charecter of a person is more about
how they are in social sittuations, which may be independent of the music taste
listening to popular music does correlate with being more extraverted tho


What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
i think maybe building some mulidimentional scale od strongest predictors
of simmilar music taste and assigning them color? idk
